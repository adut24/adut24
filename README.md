## About me
**Hello**! My name is Alexandre Dutertre. I'm a 23 years old student in [Holberton School](https://www.holbertonschool.com) LAVAL in France ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·. I'd be finishing my foundations year in 3 months and so I am currently looking for an internship in Web Development (Front End or Back End).

During the first year at Holberton, I studied among others:
- Bash
- C
- Python3

You can find the complete list at the end of this README. I can work on Web Development as well as learning new languages to work on all kind of interesting projects!

We also learned to code in group coding during various projects with the most important being:
- [printf](https://github.com/adut24/printf)
- a [simple shell](https://github.com/adut24/simple_shell)
- a clone of the [console](https://github.com/adut24/holbertonschool-AirBnB_clone) of the AirBnB, completing the AirBnB clone projects serie:
	- [web static](https://github.com/adut24/holbertonschool-AirBnB_clone/tree/main/web_static) (solo project)
